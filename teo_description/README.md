===============

ROS package with TEO humanoid description, see http://www.ros.org/wiki/teo_description

This package contains two different urdf models **teo_humanoid_attach.urdf** and **teo_humanoid.urdf**. The first one corresponds with the TEO model attached to the world. This model is used to work with Gazebo until the control is properly tuned and can stay stand up by its own. The other one is the normal model of TEO, this model is not attached to the environment.
